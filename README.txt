README:

This small web application was made over the weekend after our sixth week at skill distillery.
The app displays a picture of each president of the United States, as well as the years they served in office, their party affiliation, and their term number.
To search through the list, either enter a term number at the search bar at the top or use the buttons to either side of the screen.
